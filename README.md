# Just-an-introduce
为什么来这里（应该是第一次也是最后一次也是唯一一次在GitHub上用中文）  
&emsp;And why should I write this paragraph? No one would be here because I'm not a pro or famous people, which means no one would read this. IDK, may be I'm in some special ages. Anyway, maybe you just search a friend whose nickname is similiar with mine, or you know me in real world, finally you are here by coincident, then welcome to my little space.  
&emsp;This is my first experience to write things by Markdown and `"&emsp;"` is my second Markdown grammar (The first grammar is how to change the line and the third grammar is how to show `"&emsp;"` but not to use it). As you can see, though I'm a postgraduate student, I still need a lot to learn and improve, especially English usage. To write this stuff, I've already spent 20 mins with dozons of translations. My purpose is write an English paper on my own without any help from any translation tools or ChatGPT. That's why I have to and must suffer from this embarrasing situations.  
&emsp;As for content, I will update some notable and valuable solutions for issues while programming, system config, and some kind of retard problems. I will keep it as a notebook, or a log recording my study process. Anyway, thanks for suffering from my poor English introduction and welcome to suffer more!
